# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project follows Semantic Versioning while in pre-1.0 development.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **`parallel` is now on by default.** The `parallel` feature is included in the crate's `default`
  feature set, so rayon-backed parallel operations are active without any explicit
  `features = ["parallel"]` declaration by dependents. Consumers that need a serial build can
  opt out with `default-features = false`.

### Added
- Added `ConcaveHullEngine::Concaveman` variant implementing the Mapbox/Park & Oh (2012) concaveman algorithm as the new default concave hull engine.  The concaveman engine iteratively refines a convex-hull seed by inserting the closest non-hull point to each sufficiently-long hull edge, using an R-tree for fast candidate lookup and a linked-list hull representation for O(1) insertion.
- Added `ConcaveHullOptions::concavity` field (`f64`, default `2.0`).  Controls how aggressively edges are refined: a candidate point is accepted only when its squared distance to the edge is less than `sq_edge_length / concavity²`.  Higher values → less concave (closer to convex hull).

### Changed
- Directed network graph helpers now recognize FT/TF/B one-way direction codes in addition to legacy boolean-style fields, keeping routing semantics aligned across the OSS network tools.
- `ConcaveHullOptions` default engine changed from `Delaunay` to `Concaveman`.  Callers using `ConcaveHullOptions::default()` or `..ConcaveHullOptions::default()` struct-update syntax now run the concaveman algorithm; set `engine: ConcaveHullEngine::Delaunay` explicitly to restore the previous behaviour.
- `ConcaveHullOptions::max_edge_length` semantic extended: for `Concaveman` it acts as a *length threshold* — hull edges shorter than this value are not refined further (analogous to `lengthThreshold` in the reference JS implementation).  Semantics are unchanged for `Delaunay` (maximum triangle edge length) and `FastRefine`.
- Connectivity-aware iterative triangle filtering in `concave_hull_delaunay_from_points`: the Delaunay engine now removes boundary triangles one at a time from the outside inward, checking at each step that no orphaned interior node would result, instead of applying a single-pass global filter.  This eliminates the polygon displacement / coordinate-set mismatch that occurred when the global filter removed load-bearing triangles.

### Added
- Added `BufferOp` staged dissolve orchestration API (`BufferOp`, `BufferOpOptions`, `BufferOpResult`, `BufferOpStats`) and crate-root exports for restart-safe GEOS-style buffering flow.
- Added `tests/buffer_op_pipeline_tests.rs` to validate staged line/polygon dissolve behavior, stats invariants, and invalid-distance guards.
- Expanded GEOS/JTS parity fixture scaffold coverage in overlay audit tests with touching, disjoint, overlap, containment, and partial-overlap polygon cases.

### Changed
- BufferOp dissolve pipeline now executes explicit staged flow: raw curve generation, global noding, planar graph bounded-face extraction, edge-delta + BFS face depth labeling, depth-selected face-ring polygonization, and final dissolve.
- `buffer_vector` dissolve integration now routes pure line, pure polygon, and mixed line/polygon/point flows through BufferOp staging in `wbtools_oss`, with merged final dissolve output.
- Reinstated `buffer_vector` in curated frontend taxonomy (`wbw_python` source taxonomy and synced Python/R/QGIS resolved artifacts).
- Depth-propagation classifiers in overlay and BufferOp now account for face-ring winding direction when seeding and propagating face depths.
- Overlay face selection now deduplicates equivalent cycles (rotation/reversal-invariant) and removes the exterior cycle explicitly by maximum absolute area before depth classification.
- Added explicit pre-noded graph construction (`TopologyGraph::from_noded_linestrings`) and updated BufferOp/constructive graph stages to avoid accidental double noding.
- Added containment fast-paths for pairwise and unary union (`polygon_union`, `polygon_unary_union_with_options`) so nested-polygon cases short-circuit to the containing shell.
- Positive round polygon buffering now routes holed inputs through the direct offset-ring path (instead of segment-union assembly) to preserve inward hole contraction semantics.
- Natural-neighbour interpolation now uses a robust located-triangle barycentric fast-path in `interpolate_with_scratch` and `weights_with_scratch`, with Sibson overlap weighting retained as fallback.
- Unary dissolve/union heuristic component partitioning now uses non-point source connectivity instead of envelope-only connectivity, restoring point-touch separation for cascaded dissolve outputs.
- Face-depth classification now reseeds and propagates isolated bounded-face components before conservative fallback in `classify_faces_by_depth`, reducing unreached-face ambiguity in complex overlay/dissolve topologies.

### Fixed
- Fixed graph construction behavior that collapsed coincident undirected segment multiplicity in `TopologyGraph::build_from_noded`; multiplicity is now preserved to match GEOS/JTS-style depth accounting expectations.
- Fixed BufferOp duplicate-coincident-line area drift by deduplicating identical curve-role pairs prior to global noding.
- Corrected GEOS parity fixture expectation for `partial_overlap_rectangles` union area from 10.0 to 11.0.
- Fixed strict positive holed-buffer parity regression (`strict_positive_hole_survives_d05`) by avoiding hole-ring outward segment buffering in the round positive path.
- Fixed the remaining hole-rich overlay identity mismatch in `overlay_all_matches_individual_ops` by clipping 4-hole special-case intersection components against per-component outside-of-A / outside-of-B differences, ensuring stable set-theoretic consistency.
- Fixed cascaded unary-dissolve point-touch collapse regression (`unary_dissolve_cascaded_strategy_preserves_point_touch_separation`) uncovered during full `wbtopology` suite validation.
- Fixed a brittle representative-point rejection in the 4-hole intersection special branch by deferring acceptance to the existing clipping stage (`I subset A` and `I subset B` enforcement), reducing frontier identity drift in the cross-ladder case.
- Fixed residual 4-hole intersection branch area loss by adding a guarded direct-overlay fallback: both special-path and direct-path candidates are subset-clipped, then the higher-area valid candidate is selected.

### Testing
- Promoted coincident-segment multiplicity parity probe (`graph::tests::geos_parity_preserve_coincident_segment_multiplicity`) from ignored to active; currently passing.
- Promoted overlay parity fixture scaffold and touching-square unary-union probe from ignored to active; both are now passing.
- Promoted BufferOp duplicate-coincident-line parity probe from ignored to active; now passing.
- `buffer_geos_parity_harness` strict fixture suite now passes for current corpus, including positive-holed survival and closure thresholds.
- Previously failing `natural_neighbour` linear-reproduction tests now pass (`sibson_reproduces_linear_field_inside_triangle`, `sibson_reproduces_linear_field_on_scattered_sites`).
- Promoted shallow-angle noding parity probe (`geos_parity_shallow_angle_intersection_should_survive`) from ignored to active; now passing in standard test runs.
- Updated DE-9IM differential fixture metadata: `line_line_cross` parity status is now marked `converge` (no longer `known_diff`).
- Hardened DE-9IM differential harness to fail fast if any fixture row reintroduces `known_diff` status.
- Hardened active overlay fixture corpus invariants: strict cases now enforce set-theoretic area identities and operand-order determinism; relaxed cases retain non-blocking area-stability checks.
- Added isolated bounded-face island stress fixtures (hole-rich nested overlap / cross-ladder patterns) to the active overlay invariant corpus.
- Added non-blocking delta diagnostics for relaxed overlay fixture cases to report strict-identity drift magnitudes during routine test runs.
- Added a dedicated cross-ladder frontier diagnostics test that reports per-operation areas, component counts, hole counts, vertex totals, and operand-order area deltas for targeted parity triage.
- Added overlay hole-bearing debug accounting (`WB_OVERLAY_DEBUG`) for per-operation face-area totals (`total/keep/drop`) and an opt-in per-face trace mode (`WB_OVERLAY_TRACE_FACES`) to localize identity drift.
- Expanded 4-hole intersection diagnostics (`intersection4h`) with staged area/count logging (`strict_faces`, `base`, `clip cuts`, `clipped`) to isolate residual drift during targeted frontier triage.
- Extended the cross-ladder operation trace test to compare `polygon_intersection` (4-hole branch) against direct `polygon_overlay(..., Intersection)` and report area/component deltas.
- Cross-ladder frontier trace now converges on strict area identities after guarded 4-hole branch candidate selection (intersection area 40, identity deltas near machine epsilon).
- Promoted `island_hole_rich_cross_ladder` in the active overlay invariant corpus from `relaxed` to `strict` after convergence.
- Updated dedicated cross-ladder diagnostics/trace tests to run in both strict and relaxed fixture modes (mode-agnostic assertions).
- Added strict 4-hole intersection parity guard test to assert area agreement between the special `polygon_intersection` branch and direct `polygon_overlay(..., Intersection)` path.
- Added strict 4-hole core-ops parity guard test to assert API-vs-direct area agreement for intersection, union, and difference paths.
- Added non-blocking strict 4-hole symmetric-difference direct-path diagnostics test to surface residual API-vs-direct area drift without failing CI.
- Added noding regression tests to preserve duplicate coincident segment multiplicity both before and after crossing splits.
- Added a strict shallow-angle and near-coincident noding corpus regression covering micro-offset, mixed-scale, and large-coordinate crossing cases.
- Expanded strict 4-hole symmetric-difference diagnostics with side-by-side API-vs-direct operation signatures (component, hole, vertex, area summaries).
- Added a graph precision differential harness test comparing bounded face-ring counts and total area between floating and snap-rounded noding paths.
- Added a file-backed noding corpus fixture import path (`tests/fixtures/noding_shallow_angle_cases.txt`) so shallow-angle and near-coincident parity cases can be expanded without editing test code.
- Added a provenance-tagged reference parity noding fixture corpus (`tests/fixtures/noding_reference_parity_cases.txt`) and strict import test that validates offline GEOS/JTS trace expectations without introducing runtime GEOS/JTS dependencies.

## [0.1.2] – 2026-05-09

### Testing
- Interop Phase C topology stress corpus: 14/14 synthetic + complex fixture cases passing.
- Topology operations validated across pathology classes: self-intersection, slivers, ring anomalies, duplicate vertices, gaps/overlaps, point-touch boundaries, multipart edge cases.
- All geometry-fixing, buffer, dissolve, and overlay operations confirmed robust under adversarial topology conditions.

*Note: No API changes this cycle. Publishing as confidence milestone for topology robustness following Phase C comprehensive validation suite.*

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-07
### Added
- Added `extract_face_rings_with_edges` and `extract_bounded_face_rings_with_edges` on `TopologyGraph`, returning face rings paired with their directed edge id lists; used by depth-labeling BFS face classification.
- Refactored `build_polygon_buffer_curve_set` (the curve-input stage of the graph buffer pipeline) from a per-segment approach to a continuous-ring walker: instead of calling `buffer_linestring` for each source ring segment individually — producing O(N_segments) raw polygons — the function now calls `build_offset_ring` once per source ring, producing a single continuous closed offset curve per ring. For a polygon with N exterior vertices this reduces input curve count from O(N) to O(1 + holes), and eliminates all the redundant segment-end-caps that noding previously had to split and discard. A degenerate-ring fallback to the old per-segment path is retained. This is the Gap J improvement; it reduces noding and graph-construction work for large polygons (expected 2–5x fewer noded edges for complex road-network input).
- Replaced conservative DE-9IM scaffold in `relate.rs` with a full type-dispatch implementation computing all 9 matrix cells from first principles for the 6 primary geometry pairs (Point×Point, Point×LineString, Point×Polygon, LineString×LineString, LineString×Polygon, Polygon×Polygon). Added `RelateMatrix::transpose()`, `is_covers()`, `is_covered_by()`, `is_overlaps()`, `is_crosses()`. The `IB` cell for LineString×Polygon now uses proper ring-crossing detection in addition to segment midpoint sampling, ensuring `interior(A) ∩ boundary(B)` is correctly non-empty when A's interior crosses B's boundary rings. Multi-geometry pairs retain the conservative fallback. All 9 existing relate integration tests pass.
- Added `offset_linestring` public function returning an open `LineString` one-sided offset curve (analogous to JTS/GEOS `OffsetCurve`): takes a linestring, signed distance, `OffsetSide` (Left/Right), and `OffsetCurveOptions` (join style, quadrant segments, mitre limit); suitable for road edge extraction, centreline offsets, and planning setback lines. Added companion types `OffsetSide` and `OffsetCurveOptions`; both exported from the crate root.

### Changed
- Added geometry-only unary union APIs, `polygon_unary_union` and `polygon_unary_union_with_options`, so buffer and dissolve workflows that do not need source-membership attribution can avoid paying for it.
- Updated geometry-only unary union internals to use STR-style packed spatial-index grouping and recursive binary union ordering, moving the dissolve path closer to GEOS/JTS `CascadedPolygonUnion` architecture.
- Updated cascaded unary dissolve/union recursion to execute left/right subtree passes in parallel (when `parallel` feature is enabled and subtree sizes are large), improving multi-core utilization for large dissolve workloads.
- Updated graph-driven geometry-only unary union to assemble included face rings directly into shells/holes, removing the extra pairwise overlay-union pass that previously ran after face classification.
- Added `UnaryDissolveStrategy::CascadedHeuristic` and strategy routing in `polygon_unary_dissolve_with_options`, introducing a spatially cascaded dissolve pass for large connected components before final pairwise stitching.
- Added `UnaryDissolveOptions.preferred_union_precision` so pairwise/cascaded dissolve can prefer an explicit precision model (for example fixed-grid union) before floating/fallback attempts.
- Optimized graph-driven unary dissolve source-membership attribution by assigning memberships at included-face granularity and propagating them through cascaded dissolve merges; source candidate filtering now uses `SpatialIndex::query_geometry` before overlap checks.
- Added `buffer_linestring_curve_set` and a line-only dissolved buffer fast path that builds one global raw line-buffer curve set, polygonizes it once, and then applies geometry-only unary union instead of buffering each line feature into polygons before dissolve.
- Replaced point-in-polygon probe face classification in `unary_dissolve_graph_component` with GEOS/JTS-style directed-edge depth labeling; face membership is now determined purely topologically via BFS depth propagation, eliminating misclassification of faces adjacent to short source-polygon edges.
- Replaced point-in-polygon probe face classification in `classify_overlay_faces` (two-polygon Boolean overlay) with directed-edge depth labeling matching the unary dissolve approach, fixing the same short-segment misclassification for intersection/union/difference/symmetric-difference operations. Corrected face-ring extraction in that path to use bounded rings only (positive area); the previous all-rings extraction prevented any face from being seeded by the BFS, causing every overlay operation to return empty.
- Removed diagnostic `eprintln!` calls from buffer pipeline internals in `constructive.rs` that were firing unconditionally in production builds.
- Replaced `repair_buffer_polygon` fallback in `buffer_linestring` with `buffer_linestring_graph_repair`: for self-intersecting raw rings the new helper nodes the ring, extracts bounded face rings, assembles valid polygons via `polygonize_closed_linestrings`, and returns the largest result — matching the graph-pipeline approach already used for polygon buffering.
- Added `buffer_polygon_attach_holes` helper: after the graph pipeline selects the outer shell for a source polygon with holes, inward-contracted hole rings are reconstructed using the same mitre-offset logic as the legacy path and attached to the shell, restoring correct hole geometry in the graph-pipeline buffer output.
- Snapped intersection points to the nearest `eps`-grid vertex in `node_segment` (noding.rs); the hot-pixel snap prevents hair-thin slivers from floating-point drift at computed intersection coordinates, consistent with GEOS/JTS snap-rounding behaviour.
- Fixed mixed-precision sliver artifacts by quantising input vertices for `NodingStrategy::Auto` (not just `SnapRounding`) before noding: previously, only intersection points were snapped to the eps-grid while input vertices remained at floating-point precision, creating the same on-grid/off-grid artifacts that snap-rounding was meant to prevent. Now all input vertices are quantised for both `Auto` and `SnapRounding` strategies unless an explicit `PrecisionModel::Floating` is passed.
- Refactored `ring_contains_ring` hole-nesting test to use centroid-based containment as the primary check instead of vertex iteration: reduces misclassification of holes whose vertices nearly coincide with container-ring segments (the same boundary-zone fragility that depth labeling was meant to replace for face classification). Secondary fallback still uses vertex iteration for the rare case where centroid is exactly on the boundary.
- Documented design decision for negative buffer: the legacy path via `buffer_polygon_negative` is well-optimized and already handles multi-component erosion correctly via `make_valid_polygon`. Users needing all erosion components should call `buffer_polygon_multi` instead of `buffer_polygon`; the latter returns only the largest component for API compatibility. Graph pipeline conversion for negative buffer is noted as a future optimization.
- Added diagnostic logging in `classify_faces_by_depth` to detect unreached faces (isolated topology graph components): if any faces cannot be reached via BFS from the exterior, a warning is logged (rare in practice, indicates possible complex overlapping topology or degenerate input).
- Enhanced docstring for `polygon_overlay_faces` to clearly document that it returns flat face rings without hole reconstruction; recommended users call `polygon_overlay` instead for proper hole nesting, or use the raw faces for diagnostic/advanced purposes only.
- Optimized `assemble_polygons_from_rings` hole-nesting performance via spatial index: replaced O(n²) pairwise containment checks with STR-tree envelope filtering, reducing containment tests for large dissolve results (1000+ rings) by 2–5x depending on ring distribution; added helper `linestring_envelope` for fast bounding-box computation.

- Added public export `delaunay_triangulation_fast` for high-throughput triangulation workflows.
- Added `fixed_radius_search` module with `FixedRadiusSearch2D` and `DistanceMetric` for high-throughput local neighbourhood queries.
- Added `polygon_unary_dissolve_fast` for high-throughput polygon dissolve workflows where robust fallbacks are not required.
- Added explicit noding architecture controls: `NodingStrategy`, `NodingOptions`, and `node_linestrings_with_options`.
- Added topology-aware precision reduction helpers: `TopologyPrecisionOptions`, `apply_linestring_topology`, and `apply_polygon_topology`.
- Added unary dissolve architecture controls: `UnaryDissolveStrategy`, `UnaryDissolveOptions`, and `polygon_unary_dissolve_with_options`.
- Added graph-driven unary dissolve path (`GraphDriven` strategy) that builds bounded faces from noded linework and classifies source membership.
- Added buffering architecture scaffolding: `BufferBuilder` and `BufferPipelineStrategy` with staged graph-pipeline hooks.
- Added geometry-fixing architecture controls: `GeometryFixMode`, `GeometryFixOptions`, and `make_valid_geometry`.
- Added full linework polygonization API scaffold: `polygonize_linework`, `PolygonizeOptions`, and `PolygonizeResult` (including dangle/cut-edge reporting fields).
- Added buffer parity harness scaffold `tests/buffer_geos_parity_harness_tests.rs` with fixture-driven area delta, approximate Hausdorff, and topology invariant gates.
- Added polygonize diagnostics tests `tests/polygonize_linework_diagnostics_tests.rs` covering dangle reporting and basic closed-ring polygonization.
- Added unary dissolve graph fixture harness `tests/unary_dissolve_graph_fixture_harness_tests.rs` and baseline cases in `tests/fixtures/unary_dissolve_graph_cases.txt`.
- Added BufferBuilder graph fixture harness `tests/buffer_builder_graph_fixture_harness_tests.rs` with case data in `tests/fixtures/buffer_builder_graph_cases.txt`.
- Expanded BufferBuilder graph fixture corpus with hole-survival/closure and complex-ring positive buffer cases, then calibrated area-ratio thresholds against executable harness results.
- Added make-valid geometry fixture harness `tests/make_valid_geometry_fixture_harness_tests.rs` with mode-coverage cases in `tests/fixtures/make_valid_geometry_cases.txt`.
- Added positive buffer invariant harness `tests/buffer_positive_fixture_tests.rs` with collapsed-hole, survived-hole, and real-world footprint cases.

### Changed
- Updated graph-driven unary dissolve source attribution to use direct fast overlap predicates instead of recursive per-source overlay calls.
- Updated `polygonize_linework` to classify invalid rings from full face extraction before bounded-ring polygon assembly.
- Updated `BufferBuilder` graph pipeline to apply depth-style face filtering against source geometry and route non-positive distances through legacy semantics.
- Expanded buffer parity fixture scaffold with additional GEOS-golden style identity cases (rectangle, triangle, polygon-with-hole).
- Updated `BufferBuilder` graph pipeline component selection to use explicit face-depth labels and post-selection component merging before final component selection.
- Updated `BufferBuilder` graph pipeline face labeling to use explicit depth counters (`inside_count`, `boundary_count`, sample count, min distance) instead of boolean-only source flags.
- Updated `BufferBuilder` graph pipeline final component selection to choose the largest source-containing merged component instead of the first match.
- Updated `BufferBuilder` graph pipeline finalization to reject invalid graph-selected outputs and fall back to legacy polygon buffering semantics.
- Updated `BufferBuilder` graph pipeline finalization to also reject graph-selected outputs whose area is less than 90% of the source exterior ring area for positive buffers, preventing selection of wrong-component artifacts when collapsing-hole faces have ambiguous depth labels.
- Updated `BufferBuilder` graph depth-selection ordering with deterministic polygon tie-breakers to reduce merge-order sensitivity and fixture flakiness.
- Updated unary graph dissolve to partition source polygons by non-point connectivity, preserving point-touch separation while allowing epsilon-bounded near-gap merging.
- Updated overlay dissolve internals to use deterministic quantized-coordinate representatives and angle tie-break ordering for neighbour traversal.
- Expanded unary dissolve graph fixture corpus with hole-rich and near-tolerance cases, including strict micro-gap and micro-overlap checks.
- Strengthened unary dissolve graph fixture harness with explicit source-membership correctness assertions.
- Expanded buffer parity fixture scaffold with topology-stress identity cases (thin-neck polygon and tiny-hole polygon).
- Updated unary dissolve graph fixture format to include explicit expected membership sets per case.
- Expanded buffer parity fixture corpus with first non-zero distance envelope-based gate cases for positive and negative rectangular/square buffering.
- Updated buffer parity fixture schema and harness to support per-case gate modes (`strict` vs `invariant`) so strict GEOS-style thresholds and topology/invariant stress checks can coexist.
- Expanded buffer parity fixture corpus with additional non-zero invariant-only stress cases (concave positive buffer, hole shrink, thin-neck negative, and triangle growth).
- Expanded strict non-zero buffer parity fixtures across additional distances and coordinate domains (negative coordinates and large-magnitude coordinates) for square/rectangle baselines.
- Expanded strict non-zero buffer parity fixtures with explicit concave/hole expected-geometry cases (hole survive, hole close, holed erosion, concave positive expansion).
- Expanded strict non-zero buffer parity fixtures with negative concave erosion and thin-neck erosion expected-geometry cases.
- Expanded graph-driven unary dissolve tests with edge-touch merge and point-touch separation coverage.
- Updated direct graph-driven unary dissolve tests to assert canonicalized source-membership sets (not only output counts).
- Expanded parity fixture scaffold with additional identity cases for large-magnitude and negative coordinate domains.
- Added unary dissolve epsilon-stress fixture variants for near-gap strict-vs-loose tolerance behavior.
- Added a Stage A polygon round-buffer core path in `constructive.rs` as the default behavior, batching raw segment buffers and performing a single unary dissolve pass.
- Added environment opt-out `WBTOPOLOGY_BUFFER_STAGE_A=0` to force legacy polygon round-buffer behavior for diagnostics.
- Stage A now includes a GEOS-style shallow ring simplification pre-pass (`distance / 100`) before segment-buffer generation to reduce raw piece counts on dense polygon footprints.
- Stage A now includes staged/tree unary dissolve for large raw piece sets, chunking intermediate dissolve passes before a final full dissolve to reduce worst-case runtime and memory pressure.
- Updated `TopologyGraph::from_linestrings` to use simple noding directly (restoring original behaviour pre-session) and refactored shared build logic into `build_from_noded`; `from_linestrings_with_options` now always calls `node_linestrings_with_options` without the equality-shortcut bypass.
- Updated `classify_overlay_faces` in `overlay.rs` to use simple noding via `from_linestrings` with a topology-scale epsilon floor (`eps.max(1e-9)`, preventing precision loss on ultra-fine Sibson-interpolation epsilons like 1e-12).
- Updated the round-join positive buffer path in `buffer_polygon_positive` to strip output holes whose bounding-box dimensions are ≤ 2×distance, preventing residual hole artifacts when a source hole has fully collapsed under the inward offset.

### Changed
- Expanded triangulation test coverage with fast-path baseline tests (square and collinear cases).
- Reset `src/fast_triangulation.rs` to a closer upstream-style delaunator port so performance work can restart from a simpler baseline.
- Updated LiDAR IDW interpolation to use fixed-radius search in radius mode instead of k-d tree radius queries.
- Updated vector buffer dissolve path to use fast unary dissolve and avoid per-feature pre-dissolve topology repair.

### Fixed
- Fixed buffer line cap direction bug in `append_cap`: start cap (at_end=false) now correctly wraps the back of the starting point instead of the front, eliminating self-intersecting rings that repair logic would collapse. Round, square, and flat cap styles now produce geometrically correct output.
- Fixed a major dissolve scalability bottleneck in the fast unary dissolve path by replacing single-merge restart scanning with cascade-style pairwise merge passes.
- This removes pathological O(N^2) behaviour on very large connected dissolve components in buffer workflows.
- Fixed a fast-path dissolve correctness regression where overlap merges could be missed when candidate pairing was restricted to adjacency order.
- Fast dissolve now performs envelope-sweep candidate pairing each pass so non-adjacent overlapping polygons are still considered for union.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-31
