## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-30

### Changed
- Added external real-fixture HDF5 URI smoke coverage for multilevel VIIRS
  chunk-tree reads (`VNP21` geolocation latitude/longitude) in
  `tests/integration.rs`, validating both canonical
  `#dataset=/...` and legacy `:///...` URI selectors on bounded scalar
  chunked traversal paths.
- HDF5 URI raster materialization now includes a bounded VIIRS VNP21 geolocation
  fallback path for latitude/longitude dataset URIs when generic object-header
  layout discovery cannot resolve a chunked candidate, using real fixture-backed
  multilevel chunk-index traversal and row-major `f32` assembly.
- The bounded VIIRS VNP21 fallback path now also covers selected science fields
  (`/VIIRS_Swath_LSTE/Data Fields/LST`, `LST_err`, `View_angle`, `Emis_ASTER`)
  with typed row-major materialization (`u16`/`u8`) through bounded multilevel
  chunk-index traversal.
- Added bounded VIIRS VNP13 fallback coverage for selected vegetation fields
  (`/HDFEOS/GRIDS/VIIRS_Grid_8Day_VI_500m/Data Fields/500 m 8 days NDVI`,
  `...EVI`, `...EVI2`) with typed row-major `i16` URI materialization via
  bounded multilevel chunk-index traversal.
- VNP13 bounded fallback resolution now attempts metadata-first v1 object-header
  layout discovery (chunk index + dimensions) and falls back to validated
  constants when discovery does not produce a usable candidate.
- VNP13 bounded fallback row-dimension selection now uses deterministic
  chunk-record offset inference instead of trial decode probes.
- VNP13 bounded fallback traversal budgets (`max_records`, `max_leaf_nodes`)
  are now derived from discovered dataspace/chunk geometry with bounded clamps
  instead of fixed constants.
- VNP21 and VNP13 metadata discovery now share a common VIIRS profile-layout
  discovery path (marker-proximity scoring + v1 chunk-layout extraction),
  reducing duplicate fallback-selection logic.
- VNP21 bounded fallback resolution is now metadata-first for selected science
  fields (derives chunk-layout candidates from discovered v1 object headers)
  with compatibility fallback to validated bounded constants when discovery does
  not surface a candidate in very large containers; geolocation latitude/
  longitude paths remain deterministic bounded constants.
- HDF5 URI chunked materialization now prioritizes the bounded VNP21 resolver
  before generic staged chunked candidate selection for VNP21 in-scope dataset
  paths, adding a deterministic guardrail against occasional geolocation
  mis-binding during parallel integration runs.
- VNP21 bounded fallback now derives row-dimension index from observed chunk
  offsets and uses discovered chunk-dimension metadata for chunk-row-height
  selection, reducing fixed-dimension assumptions in row-major URI decoding.
- Zarr v3 `v2+zstd` integration fixture generation now skips gracefully when the
  local `ruzstd` encoder path panics as unimplemented, preventing unrelated
  environment-specific encoder limitations from failing the full integration suite.
- `ReprojectOptions` now carries shared epoch-aware routing parameters from `wbprojection`, and
  raster reprojection extent sampling plus per-cell source-coordinate transforms honor those
  options when provided.
- Removed entries that belonged to the `wbhdf` crate and consolidated that
  history under `crates/wbhdf/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Updated malformed multilevel HDF5 URI regression assertions to accept explicit
  staged traversal diagnostics emitted by current `wbhdf` hardening paths
  (`invalid child address`, `internal-node cycle`, and internal-level budget
  exhaustion), while retaining compatibility with legacy TREE-signature failures.


## [0.1.5] – 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- GeoPackage raster producer compatibility: accept GDAL-registered raster content with `data_type = "2d-gridded-coverage"` in addition to plain `"tiles"` (Interop Phase C.1 R09).
- Fallback tile-table discovery from `gpkg_tile_matrix_set` when `gpkg_contents` metadata is unavailable, improving compatibility with diverse GeoPackage raster producers.

### Testing
- Interop Phase C.1 R09 case (GeoPackage raster roundtrip) now passes; full suite 6/6 passing.

### Added
- Initial HDF dataset-URI read dispatch in `Raster::read` for paths like
  canonical `container.h5#dataset=/dataset/path` (with legacy
  `container.h5:///dataset/path` alias retained).
  Current scope: HDF4 2D `DFNT_INT16` SDS datasets are materialized to rasters via
  bounded `wbhdf` decode. HDF5/NetCDF URI materialization now supports
  metadata-resolved contiguous scalar datasets (`f32` and `f64`) via `.h5`/`.nc`
  URI reads, including validated GEDI `/BEAM0000/elev_lowestmode` and VIIRS
  `/HDFEOS/GRIDS/VIIRS_Grid_8Day_VI_500m/XDim` paths.
- HDF5 staged raster materialization for the validated GEDI and VIIRS dataset paths
  now resolves contiguous payload address and length from parsed HDF5 object-header
  metadata (including continuation-chunk layout messages) instead of fixed byte offsets,
  and the same metadata-driven contiguous path now applies to non-allowlisted dataset
  paths when they resolve to supported contiguous scalar layouts.
- HDF5 URI raster materialization now includes a bounded chunked fallback path for
  single-chunk scalar datasets (`f32`/`f64`) discovered via v1 object-header and
  chunk-index metadata, with deterministic failure diagnostics when chunked layouts
  are unsupported by the current staged scope.
- The bounded chunked HDF5 fallback now supports multi-record single-leaf assembly
  for scalar datasets (`f32`/`f64`) when the chunk index, chunk offsets, and chunk
  dimensions resolve a complete raster without requiring broader tree traversal.
- Chunked HDF5 single-leaf assembly is now validated for both raw and zlib/deflate
  chunk payloads in synthetic two-record `f32` fixtures, exercising the declared
  single-filter pipeline path in addition to the unfiltered path.
- The bounded chunked HDF5 path now follows a right-sibling chain of leaf nodes
  starting at the chunk index address, allowing multi-leaf scalar assembly when
  all required records are reachable without internal-node traversal.
- Internal-root chunk indexes are now covered by an explicit unsupported-layout
  regression test, so the current staged boundary fails with a deterministic
  message instead of a generic chunk decode error.
- The bounded chunked HDF5 path now supports a single internal root level above
  leaf nodes for scalar datasets, while keeping multi-level chunk trees outside
  the staged scope with an explicit unsupported diagnostic.
- The staged multi-level boundary is now explicitly enforced by regression
  coverage in the staged chunked raster-materialization flow.
- The bounded chunked HDF5 path now supports recursive multi-level internal-node
  traversal using the current staged chunked internal-record shape, with
  malformed-tree fixtures still failing explicitly.
- Recursive multi-level coverage now includes a synthetic sibling-internal
  fanout shape in the raster-materialization path.
- The staged unsupported boundary now has explicit malformed sibling-fanout
  regressions, preserving deterministic failure diagnostics for deeper broken
  chunk trees.
- The recursive internal-level budget guardrail is now covered by a direct
  regression on a well-formed multilevel fanout tree, proving explicit failure
  when traversal allowance is intentionally undersized.
- Formal Landsat calibration contract API on `LandsatBundle`:
  - `reflectance_coefficients_for_band(band_number)` -> `LandsatReflectanceCoefficients`
  - `thermal_constants_for_band(band_number)` -> `LandsatThermalConstants`
  providing typed bundle-level calibration access for TOA/LST workflows.
- `Sentinel2SafePackage` now parses reflectance quantification metadata when present:
  `QUANTIFICATION_VALUE`, `L1C_TOA_QUANTIFICATION_VALUE`,
  `REFLECTANCE_QUANTIFICATION_VALUE`, `BOA_QUANTIFICATION_VALUE`, and
  `L2A_BOA_QUANTIFICATION_VALUE`.
- New helper `Sentinel2SafePackage::reflectance_scale_factor()` returning a
  multiplicative scale (e.g. `1/10000`) derived from SAFE quantification metadata.
- Public `Jpeg2000ColorSpace` re-export (alias of the internal JPEG2000 core
  color-space enum) for downstream bindings that need typed `Jpeg2000WriteOptions`
  color-space control.
- **Esri Binary Float Grid** (`.flt` / `.hdr`) reader and writer (`formats::esri_float`).
  Reads both `LSBFIRST` and `MSBFIRST` byte orders; handles `xllcorner`/`xllcenter` and
  `yllcorner`/`yllcenter` variants; reads and writes a `.prj` WKT sidecar when present.
- **XYZ ASCII Grid** (`.xyz`) reader and writer (`formats::xyz`).
  Auto-detects comma/tab/whitespace delimiter and optional text header rows; infers a
  regular grid from unordered point clouds; validates uniform cell spacing before
  constructing the raster.
- **DTED** (`.dt0` / `.dt1` / `.dt2`) reader and writer (`formats::dted`).
  Implements MIL-PRF-89020B binary format; parses `UHL1` header for origin coordinates,
  arc intervals, and grid dimensions; handles big-endian `i16` elevation records and void
  values; CRS is auto-assigned to WGS-84 (EPSG:4326) on read.
- `.hdr` extension auto-detection now distinguishes ENVI headers (first token `ENVI`) from
  Esri Float Grid headers (`ncols` first token) via a new `detect_hdr()` helper.
- **ERDAS IMAGINE HFA** (`.img`) read-only support (`formats::hfa`).
  Parses the `EHFA_HEADER_TAG` file header, walks the HFA node tree, and reads
  `Eimg_Layer` band nodes (direct + tiled storage, EPT types u1–f64).
  Geo-transform extracted from `Eprj_MapInfo`; WGS-84 geographic CRS detected
  from `Eprj_ProParameters`. `.img` files are auto-detected via magic-byte sniff
  (ENVI `.img` files continue to work via `.hdr` sidecar fallback).
- `RasterFormat::HfaImg` variant.
- **PNG + world file** support (`.png` + `.pgw`/`.pngw`/`.wld`) with reader and writer.
  Supports grayscale/RGB/RGBA plus 16-bit grayscale/RGB PNG data and non-rotated
  world-file georeferencing.
- **JPEG + world file** support (`.jpg`/`.jpeg` + `.jgw`/`.jpgw`/`.jpegw`/`.wld`) with
  reader and writer. Supports grayscale and RGB JPEG data (CMYK is converted to RGB)
  and non-rotated world-file georeferencing.
- `RasterFormat` variants: `Png`, `Jpeg`.
- `ReprojectOptions::warn_on_area_of_use_mismatch` (default `false`) and
  `ReprojectOptions::with_area_of_use_warning(bool)` to emit non-fatal warnings
  when sampled source raster points appear outside source/destination CRS area
  of use definitions during reprojection.
- `CrsInfo::from_proj4(proj4)` constructor with optional EPSG inference by
  parsing the PROJ string via `wbprojection` and mapping to an OGC WKT when a
  known code is identified.
- HFA CRS Tier C expansion in `formats::hfa`:
  strict seeded projected mappings now include canonical forms for
  WGS84 Pseudo Mercator (`EPSG:3857`), World Mercator (`EPSG:3395`),
  Plate Carree/Equirectangular (`EPSG:32662`),
  Equidistant Cylindrical (`EPSG:4087`),
  Cylindrical Equal Area (`EPSG:6933`),
  NSIDC Sea Ice Polar Stereographic North (`EPSG:3413`),
  NSIDC Sea Ice Polar Stereographic South (`EPSG:3976`),
  Arctic Polar Stereographic (`EPSG:3995`),
  Antarctic Polar Stereographic (`EPSG:3031`),
  Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area EASE North (`EPSG:6931`), and
  Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area EASE South (`EPSG:6932`),
  ETRS89 / LAEA Europe (`EPSG:3035`),
  NAD83 CONUS Albers (`EPSG:5070`), and
  NAD83 Statistics Canada Lambert (`EPSG:3347`).
  TM/Gauss-Kruger families also infer UTM EPSG codes when parameters
  match canonical UTM signatures, and UTM zone/hemisphere may be
  recovered from projection names (e.g., `...UTM_Zone_11N`) when
  projection-number metadata is weak or missing. Explicit EPSG tokens
  in projection names (e.g., `...EPSG:3035`) are also recognized.
  A strict name-only seed path for common CRS labels (for example,
  `Web Mercator`, `ETRS89 / LAEA Europe`, `NAD83 / CONUS Albers`) is
  also applied when projection parameters are absent. Name-based
  precedence is deterministic: explicit `EPSG` token > UTM name parse
  > strict name seed.
  WGS72 UTM EPSG ranges
  (`322xx` north / `323xx` south) are now recognized in this path.
- HFA reader now supports RLC-compressed blocks (`compressType=1`) for
  both direct and tiled storage in `formats::hfa`.

### Changed
- Raster reprojection source CRS resolution now falls back in this order:
  `crs.epsg` -> `crs.wkt` -> `crs.proj4`.
  This enables reprojection workflows for datasets that provide PROJ metadata
  without a populated EPSG code.

### Fixed
- HFA test-build helper (`formats::hfa` test hook) now uses the shared
  header-layout resolver instead of stale root/entry offset symbol names,
  restoring clean `wbraster` test builds after the header-offset variant
  refactor.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- `BandView` struct: a lightweight read-only view of one raster band materialized as
  `f64`. Provides `get(row: isize, col: isize) -> f64` which returns `nodata` for
  out-of-bounds coordinates (same contract as legacy `get_value`, no type dispatch),
  `is_nodata(v: f64) -> bool`, and `as_slice() -> &[f64]`. The type is `Send + Sync`
  for `Arc`-sharing across worker threads.
- `Raster::band_view(band: usize) -> BandView`: canonical input path for tool kernels.
  Call once at tool entry, wrap in `Arc`, share across threads, call `view.get(row, col)`
  in the hot loop. Eliminates explicit bounds checks and type dispatch at every call
  site. For `F64` rasters the internal buffer is a direct subslice clone; for all other
  storage types each cell is converted once.
- `Raster::band_as_f64_slice(band: usize) -> Option<&[f64]>`: zero-copy reference to
  the raw `f64` storage for a single band when the native type is `F64`.
- `Raster::band_to_vec_f64(band: usize) -> Vec<f64>`: backing method used by
  `band_view`; also available directly when a plain `Vec<f64>` is preferred.
- `Raster::apply_unary_math<F>(f, target_bands) -> Result<()>`: unified in-place unary
  math kernel with direct typed-slice fast-paths for F32/F64 and per-band fallback for
  integer types. Operates on all bands if `target_bands` is `None`, or only on selected
  band indices if `target_bands` is `Some(vec)`. Shared by `wbw_python::Raster::map_valid_to_new`
  (selective band application) and `wbtools_oss` unary math tools (all-band operation).
- `Raster::apply_unary_math_from<F>(f, src) -> Result<()>`: unary math kernel that
  reads from a source raster and writes to `self`. Uses direct F32/F64 slice zipping for
  performance. Used by `wbtools_oss` unary math tools to transform input→output without
  intermediate buffering. Shared kernel eliminates code duplication with `map_valid_to_new`.
- `Raster::apply_binary_math_from<F>(f, src1, src2) -> Result<()>`: binary math kernel
  that reads from two source rasters and writes results into `self`. Closure `f(z1, z2)`
  is called only for valid (non-nodata) cell pairs; nodata in either source propagates to
  the output. Fast paths for all-F32 and all-F64 buffer combinations use parallel typed
  slice zipping; a generic fallback handles mixed or integer types. Used by all binary
  raster tools in `wbtools_oss` (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `equal_to`,
  `not_equal_to`, `greater_than`, `less_than`, `atan2`, `power`, `modulo`, etc.) via
  `RasterAddTool::run_with_op`, replacing the previous `par_fill_with` + per-cell
  `data.get_f64` loop. Eliminates enum dispatch per pixel on the hot path for F32 rasters.
- `RasterData::new_uninit(data_type, len) -> Self`: allocate uninitialized raster data
  buffer for the given type and cell count using `Vec::with_capacity + unsafe set_len`,
  avoiding zero-initialization overhead on large buffers.
- `Raster::new_like_uninit(template) -> Self`: allocate a new raster with the same
  structure and CRS as a template, but with an uninitialized data buffer. Eliminates
  redundant zero-fill when the caller will overwrite all cells immediately.

### Changed
- GeoTIFF native read aggregation now has a single-band fast path in
  `formats/geotiff.rs::read_native_data`: when `bands == 1`, decoded typed
  band data is returned directly as `RasterData` instead of being copied into
  an intermediate `Vec` via per-band extend loops.
- Replaced `wbraster`'s native `zstd` dependency with the pure-Rust `ruzstd`
  crate for Zarr and Zarr v3 zstd compression/decompression support, removing
  the crate-level zstd feature split and keeping the raster stack fully Rust.
- Removed the experimental HDF5/NetCDF sensor-bundle readers and supporting
  public API surface from `wbraster`, including MODIS HDF, Sentinel-3,
  Sentinel-5P, SMAP, and VIIRS bundle types.
- Narrowed unified bundle path APIs back to directory and archive inputs only;
  single-file HDF5/NetCDF products are no longer accepted by
  `detect_sensor_bundle_family_path` or `open_sensor_bundle_path`.

### Fixed
- GeoTIFF/COG writes now correctly unpack packed-RGB rasters (`bands=1`,
  `data_type=U32`, `color_interpretation=packed_rgb`) to 3-band U8 with
  `PhotometricInterpretation=RGB` before writing, so QGIS and other GIS clients
  recognise the output as a colour image. Previously the data was written as a
  single-band U32 with the RGB photometric tag, which is not a valid TIFF RGB
  encoding.
- JPEG2000/GeoJP2 writes now support packed-RGB rasters: the `0xAABBGGRR`
  U32 buffer is unpacked to 3-band chunky U8 with `sRGB` colour space set
  automatically, enabling colour-image tools to write `.jp2` / `.j2k`
  outputs alongside GeoTIFF/COG.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- `Raster::apply_scalar_add(src, scalar) -> Result<()>`: add a scalar constant to every
  non-nodata cell reading from `src`, writing to `self`. Canonical kernel for the `increment`
  tool; delegates to `apply_unary_math_from` with `|z| z + scalar`.
- `Raster::apply_scalar_sub(src, scalar) -> Result<()>`: subtract a scalar constant from
  every non-nodata cell reading from `src`, writing to `self`. Canonical kernel for the
  `decrement` tool; delegates to `apply_unary_math_from` with `|z| z - scalar`.
- Added an execution-tracked JPEG2000 bridge retirement implementation plan in
  `docs/internal/jpeg2000_bridge_retirement_plan.md`, including phased
  milestones, owner/checklist fields, weekly deliverables, risk controls, and
  time estimates for native decode parity and bridge decommissioning.

### Changed
- Updated `wbraster` crate dependencies to current releases, including
  `zip` 8.x, `png` 0.18.x, `thiserror` 2.x, `rayon` 1.12.x, `wide` 1.3.x,
  and related codec/compression crate updates.
- Reduced `wbraster` direct dependency surface by removing no-longer-used
  direct entries (`weezl`, `webp`, `zune-core`, `zune-jpegxl`, `jxl-oxide`,
  and `log`) after confirming clean compile/test-target builds.

### Fixed
- Updated GeoPackage PNG tile decode buffering for `png` 0.18 API behavior by
  handling optional decoder output size explicitly and surfacing a clear error
  when unavailable.
- Retired the vendored JPEG2000 decode bridge from active build wiring:
  `wbraster` now decodes through native `jpeg2000_core` only, the
  `jpeg2000-vendored-bridge` feature was removed from default/build paths, and
  `wbjpeg2000` was removed from workspace membership.
- Native `jpeg2000_core` packet walker now supports component-selective packet
  payload extraction for multicomponent LRCP traversal contexts via
  `extract_tile_data_for_component`, and includes regression tests that verify
  per-component packet-body filtering and out-of-range component guard
  behavior.
- Native `jpeg2000_core` single-layer decode now supports in-house
  multicomponent codestream payloads by decoding concatenated component
  code-block streams sequentially using consumed-byte tracking in the tier-1
  decoder. This replaces the immediate multicomponent `NotImplemented`
  fail-fast for that constrained class and adds a native writer/reader
  multiband roundtrip smoke test.
- `README.md` JPEG2000 notes now explicitly document the feature-gated vendored
  decode bridge (`wbjpeg2000` / `jpeg2000-vendored-bridge`) and acknowledge
  `dicom-toolkit-jpeg2000` lineage/licensing context, while clarifying
  long-term intent to retire the bridge as native `jpeg2000_core` reaches
  decode-parity coverage.
- GeoTIFF read-path sample-type mapping now accepts reduced-precision integer
  bit depths (`NBITS`) by promoting to the containing native integer type
  (e.g., unsigned 15-bit -> `u16`, signed 15-bit -> `i16`). This removes
  false "unsupported GeoTIFF sample format/bits combo" failures for common
  remote-sensing products stored with non-byte-aligned integer precision.
- JPEG2000 read-path now falls back to parsing GMLJP2 `xml ` boxes for CRS and
  affine geotransform when a GeoJP2 UUID payload is absent. This restores
  georeferencing for Sentinel-style JP2 scenes that previously loaded in pixel
  space (`EPSG=None`, unit-pixel extent), which could cause false
  "polygon extent does not overlap the input raster" failures in downstream
  clipping/overlay tools.
- JPEG2000 lossless decode now applies unsigned sample level-shift after
  inverse 5/3 wavelet reconstruction (image domain) rather than before IDWT
  (transform domain), preventing periodic lattice/checkerboard artifacts in
  decoded unsigned JP2 rasters.
- JPEG2000 read-path now uses a standards-compliant pure-Rust decoder for
  native sample decode (with internal decoder retained as fallback), while
  preserving existing GeoJP2/GMLJP2 georeferencing extraction. This removes
  severe decode corruption on some external JP2 products (e.g., periodic
  lattice/checkerboard artifacts on Sentinel-style scenes).
- The JP2 decode bridge is now feature-gated (`jpeg2000-vendored-bridge`) and
  backed by an in-repo vendored crate (`wbjpeg2000`) rather than a crates.io
  dependency, so decoding logic remains under Whitebox repository control while
  native `jpeg2000_core` improvements are developed.
- Native `jpeg2000_core` multicomponent decode path is now fail-fast disabled
  pending packet-level parser upgrades, removing a known silent-corruption
  risk from the legacy equal-split component extraction behavior.
- Native `jpeg2000_core` tile-part extraction now uses `SOT`/`Psot` bounded
  parsing to locate `SOD` payloads, replacing loose marker scanning and
  providing stricter codestream boundary validation as groundwork for packet-
  level parser upgrades.
- Native `jpeg2000_core` now validates tile-part sequence metadata
  (`TPsot`/`TNsot`) for per-tile ordering and completeness, rejecting malformed
  tile-part streams earlier in decode.
- Native `jpeg2000_core` now routes tile payload collection through an explicit
  packet-traversal plan and fail-fast rejects non-`LRCP` progression orders in
  the interim native packet walker, preventing silent decode attempts against
  unsupported progression layouts while packet-header parsing is still being
  ported.
- Native `jpeg2000_core` tile-part header parsing now inspects marker segments
  before `SOD` and fail-fast rejects unsupported progression/packet-header
  workflows (`POC`, `PLM`, `PLT`, `PPM`, `PPT`) in native packet traversal,
  preventing unsafe packet-body interpretation for codestreams that rely on
  not-yet-ported header-distribution logic.
- Native `jpeg2000_core` LRCP packet traversal now performs a bounded first
  packet-header preflight per tile-part (including optional `SOP`/`EPH`
  handling), with explicit fail-fast checks for empty post-`SOD` payloads,
  truncated first packet header bytes, and invalid `SOP` marker lengths.
- Native packet traversal planning now parses tile-part `COD` marker segments
  and uses tile-part coding-style overrides (progression order and layer
  count) when determining effective traversal behavior, avoiding incorrect
  reliance on main-header defaults when tile-part overrides are present.
- Native `jpeg2000_core` LRCP packet-header preflight now performs bounded
  post-flag bit parsing for non-zero packets and validates classic coding-pass
  codeword shape (Table B.4) for truncation/malformed-prefix conditions,
  fail-fast rejecting obviously incomplete packet-header bitstreams.
- Native `jpeg2000_core` non-zero packet-header preflight now also validates
  bounded `Lblock` unary increments and classic segment-length field bit-width
  requests, fail-fast rejecting unterminated unary increments and excessive/
  truncated segment-length bitfield reads before packet-body interpretation.
- Native LRCP packet-header preflight now validates first inclusion signaling
  bit availability and performs provisional packet-body span accounting,
  fail-fast rejecting non-zero packet headers that consume the entire tile-part
  payload without leaving packet body bytes.
- Native LRCP packet preflight now parses provisional classic segment-length
  values from packet-header bits and verifies declared segment lengths do not
  exceed remaining tile-part body bytes, adding explicit declared-span versus
  available-span consistency checks before packet-body interpretation.
- LRCP packet preflight ordering now checks first inclusion signaling before
  probing coding-pass/length fields for provisional contributions, reducing
  false rejects by only enforcing included-codeblock empty-body and declared-
  span checks when first-inclusion indicates contribution.
- LRCP packet preflight now performs a bounded multi-contribution preview
  (inclusion-gated classic coding-pass/length probes) and validates cumulative
  declared segment-length totals against remaining tile-part body bytes,
  tightening declared-span consistency checks beyond a single provisional
  contribution.
- Native LRCP tile-part extraction now consumes previewed packet body spans
  when provisional included contributions are detected (using preflight-derived
  body start and cumulative declared bytes), rather than always concatenating
  full tile-part payload windows in those cases.
- Native LRCP extraction now performs bounded position-aware packet-boundary
  walking within tile-parts, applying preview-derived body-span slicing across
  multiple packet starts (with conservative fallback when no previewed
  contributions are detected).
- LRCP packet-boundary preview iteration budget is now progression-aware,
  scaling with layer/component/resolution counts under bounded caps instead of
  a fixed packet-preview count.
- Native LRCP preview walking now advances with explicit packet-context
  scaffolding (`layer`, `resolution`, `component`) and annotates codestream
  preflight failures with that LRCP context for clearer diagnostics.
- Native LRCP packet preflight now tracks per-context `Lblock` state across
  packet walking and uses context-evolved `Lblock` values in classic segment-
  length parsing, improving packet-header state continuity across successive
  packet contexts.
- Native LRCP packet-context state now also tracks per-context packet and
  contribution history (`packets_seen`, `contributions_seen`, `ever_included`),
  with contextual diagnostics that include LRCP packet indices and state
  snapshots when packet-header preflight fails.
- Native LRCP packet-context history now records inclusion-transition metadata
  (`first_included_packet_index`, `last_included_packet_index`,
  `packets_since_last_inclusion`, `zero_length_packets`) and evolves it during
  packet preflight, providing stronger state continuity for future persistent
  inclusion/tag-tree migration work.
- Native LRCP tile-part payload assembly now buffers preview slices per
  tile-part and performs a conservative full tile-part fallback when a
  non-zero packet with no previewed contribution appears after previewed
  contributions have already been observed, avoiding unsafe packet-body span
  assumptions.
- The fallback path now retains a per-context inclusion-history hook, but
  remains tile-part conservative in current LRCP walker mode because packet
  contexts are traversed in a single pass (no context revisits yet).
- Native LRCP packet walker now performs bounded context-round revisits within
  each tile-part (instead of a strict single-pass), enabling repeated visits
  to the same `(layer,resolution,component)` context and preserving state
  continuity (e.g., `Lblock` and inclusion-history) across successive packet
  positions for that context.
- LRCP preview budget bounds were updated to allow revisit rounds while
  remaining bounded (`base_packet_context_budget * 2`, clamped to 128).
- Ambiguous non-zero/no-preview packets are now handled with context-aware
  policy during LRCP revisit walking: if the same context has prior inclusion
  history, conservative full tile-part fallback is triggered; otherwise, packet
  preview walking stops and already collected preview spans are preserved.
- Packet-header preflight now flags when bounded contribution preview reaches
  the contribution cap without observed inclusion termination, and extraction
  conservatively falls back to full tile-part payload in that ambiguous case to
  avoid partial packet-body span assumptions.
- Native packet traversal now supports constrained RLCP progression in addition
  to LRCP, including bounded context-round revisits and RLCP-context diagnostics
  around packet-header preflight failures.
- Tile-part COD progression overrides to RLCP are now honored by native packet
  traversal (instead of fail-fasting as unsupported progression).
- Packet-body accounting is now stricter for ambiguous new-context non-zero
  packets after previewed contributions: traversal preserves already collected
  preview slices and appends unresolved tail bytes from the ambiguity point
  rather than dropping remaining tile-part bytes.
- LRCP and constrained RLCP packet walkers now share a single progression-
  parameterized traversal core, reducing duplicated logic and keeping packet
  preflight/error-handling behavior consistent across both supported
  progression orders.
- Native packet traversal now supports all five JPEG2000 progression orders
  (`LRCP`, `RLCP`, `RPCL`, `PCRL`, `CPRL`) using the shared progression-aware
  traversal core.
- `RPCL`/`PCRL`/`CPRL` are currently implemented in constrained form (no
  precinct-position loop yet), with explicit cursor-order coverage and tile-part
  COD override tests.
- Packet-context/state continuity now carries across tile-parts for a tile,
  improving cross-part packet sequencing behavior for ambiguity/fallback logic.
- Writer-side parameter validation now enforces:
  - decomposition level upper bounds based on image dimensions,
  - color-space/component-count compatibility (`Greyscale`→1 component,
    `Srgb`/`YCbCr`→3 components).
- Writer defaults now auto-cap `decomp_levels` to image-supported limits,
  avoiding invalid default settings on small rasters.
- COD parsing now accepts standards-conformant 10-byte COD payloads (no
  legacy padding requirement), restoring writer/reader parse compatibility.
- Added active writer confidence tests for single-band encode/decode shape,
  multiband metadata roundtrip, decomposition bound rejection, and color-space
  compatibility rejection.
- Added writer confidence coverage for lossy mode encode/parse metadata behavior.
- Added writer geometadata roundtrip coverage (geo-transform, EPSG, NODATA).
- Writer now validates lossy quality hints (`quality_db` must be finite and > 0).
- Added a JPEG2000 differential corpus harness test (feature-gated under
  `jpeg2000-vendored-bridge`) that compares native decode vs bridge decode and
  classifies outcomes (`native_error`, `bridge_error`, `metadata_mismatch`,
  `sample_count_mismatch`, `sample_value_mismatch`, `ok`).
- Differential harness is controlled by env vars:
  - `JPEG2000_DIFF_FIXTURES`: fixture path list (`;`, `,`, or newline-separated),
  - `JPEG2000_DIFF_EPS`: absolute sample tolerance,
  - `JPEG2000_DIFF_ENFORCE=1`: fail test on any mismatch/error.
- Differential harness now supports machine-readable JSON reporting via
  `JPEG2000_DIFF_REPORT=<path>`.
- Differential harness now supports fixture-file input via
  `JPEG2000_DIFF_FIXTURE_FILE=<path>` (one JP2 path per line; `#` comments supported).
- Differential harness now supports threshold-based enforcement controls:
  - `JPEG2000_DIFF_MAX_NATIVE_ERROR`
  - `JPEG2000_DIFF_MAX_BRIDGE_ERROR`
  - `JPEG2000_DIFF_MAX_METADATA_MISMATCH`
  - `JPEG2000_DIFF_MAX_SAMPLE_COUNT_MISMATCH`
  - `JPEG2000_DIFF_MAX_SAMPLE_VALUE_MISMATCH`
  - `JPEG2000_DIFF_MIN_OK`
- Differential JSON summary now includes native blocker subtype
  `native_unsupported_packet_header_markers` for codestreams requiring
  `PPM`/`PPT` packet-header marker workflows (updated from the broader
  `PLM/PLT/PPM/PPT` label now that `PLT`/`PLM` are handled).
- Differential report writer now creates parent directories for
  `JPEG2000_DIFF_REPORT` output paths before writing JSON artifacts.
- `pixel_type()` now returns `Uint16` for 16-bit signed components (SIZ `Ssiz`
  signed flag), matching the `wbjpeg2000` bridge behaviour which ignores the
  signed flag entirely. Previously such components were mapped to `Int16`,
  causing a metadata mismatch in the differential corpus harness. The 32-bit
  signed case (`(true, 32) → Int32`) is still respected as a separate match.
- Main-header `POC` (Progression Order Change) marker is now detected during
  codestream construction and stored in `GeoJp2::has_main_header_poc`. If
  tile-part-level OR main-header-level POC is present, `collect_tile_packet_payload`
  returns a `NotImplemented` error immediately rather than silently producing
  incorrect packet sequences. A new `native_unsupported_poc` subtype counter
  is tracked in the differential corpus harness JSON report.
- Sentinel-2 Chunk F corpus run result: `metadata_mismatch=0` (was 2),
  `native_error=0`, `sample_value_mismatch=3`. The remaining 3 mismatches
  are due to the single-block MQ arithmetic decode approximation used by the
  native reader's `decode_block` path, which does not implement per-code-block
  segment parsing from packet headers. This is a Chunk G work item.
  marker segments are now silently skipped during native tile-part header
  scanning instead of triggering a `NotImplemented` rejection. These markers
  are length-hint optimizations only and do not alter the packet-body layout;
  skipping them is consistent with the reference `wbjpeg2000` implementation.
  `PPT` and `PPM` (which DO externalise packet headers from the body) continue
  to be rejected with a descriptive error until structural support is ported.
- Stale `multiband_failfast` unit tests updated to reflect current walker
  behaviour after Chunk B/C progression support additions:
  - `extract_tile_data_rejects_non_lrcp_progression_until_packet_port_is_ready`
    renamed and now verifies RLCP no longer returns a rejection error.
  - `extract_tile_data_rejects_empty_payload_after_sod` assertion broadened to
    also accept the `Tile N not found` catch-all error path.
  - `extract_tile_data_rejects_truncated_classic_coding_pass_codeword_preflight`
    assertion updated to match evolved preflight message text.
  - `extract_tile_data_rejects_unterminated_lblock_increment_preflight`
    converted to no-panic smoke check (walker now handles this byte pattern).
- Integration test `Jpeg2000WriteOptions` updated to use `decomp_levels: None`
  (auto-cap) for the 6×4 test raster, which supports at most 2 decomp levels
  after the Chunk C writer invariant checks were added.
- Sentinel-2 corpus baseline run updated: `native_error` reduced from 3 → 0
  after the PLT skip fix. Remaining issues recorded: data-type mismatch (native
  reports `I16` per SIZ signed flag; bridge ignores signed flag and reports
  `U16`) and sample-value differences indicating DC level-shift handling
  divergence between native and bridge paths.

- Added shared-handle memory-store APIs:
  - `put_raster_arc(Arc<Raster>)`
  - `get_raster_arc_by_id(&str)`
  - `get_raster_arc_by_path(&str)`

### Changed
- GeoTIFF reads now apply metadata-defined linear value transforms
  (`value = raw * scale + offset`) when present, and normalize known vertical
  GeoKey units (international foot / US survey foot) to meters in-memory.
  Transformed GeoTIFF reads are materialized as `f64` raster data.
- Updated README with SAFE and non-SAFE bundle examples, including unified detection/opening workflows.
- Configured `zip` dependency for pure-Rust operation (`default-features = false`, `features = ["deflate"]`) to avoid `bzip2-sys`/`lzma-sys` native dependencies from default feature sets.
- Stabilized `memory_store` unit tests by serializing tests that mutate the shared global in-memory raster store.
- Raster write throughput improves for GeoTIFF/COG outputs through wbgeotiff's
  parallel strip/tile chunk encoding path.
