# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project follows Semantic Versioning while in pre-1.0 development.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Removed explicit `features = ["parallel"]` from `wbprojection`, `wblidar`, and `wbtopology`
  dependencies. All three crates now include `parallel` in their `default` feature set, so
  parallel support is guaranteed automatically without caller-side declarations.

### Added
- Field parameter schemas are now exposed through R bindings via `list_tools_json(...)` and `get_tool_metadata_json(...)` helper functions. R users and downstream consumers (Shiny apps, R scripts) can introspect field parameters and their parent layer references for dynamic validation and metadata enrichment.
- Schema JSON includes `kind: "field"` and `parent: <layer_name>` for all 40+ tools with field parameter support (interpolation, spatial stats, vector ops, linear referencing, network analysis, classification).

### Fixed
- Fixed `longest_flowpath` tool output type schema exposed through R bindings. The tool now correctly identifies its output as vector (via `output_vector_any()` schema) instead of raster. R-side metadata consumers and Shiny applications will correctly render output parameter as vector layer sink.
- Fixed `polygons_to_lines` output through R bindings. The tool now produces properly closed line strings from polygon rings (appends first coordinate if not already closed). R users and Shiny applications will receive complete, closed polylines.

## [2.0.6] - 2026-06-14

### Changed
- Added epoch-aware reprojection guidance and advanced argument examples to the
  reprojection manual (`manual/src/reprojection-and-crs.md`) for raster,
  vector, and LiDAR workflows.

### Fixed
- Fixed `quantiles` tool producing incorrect results (all pixels assigned highest class) on rasters with extreme positive skewness. The backend histogram-based calculation used fixed bin counts that resulted in coarse quantile boundaries, collapsing all quantile thresholds into a single bin on highly skewed data. The tool now uses an adaptive-bin histogram that scales with valid cell count (up to 4M bins, 32 MB cap), correctly resolving quantile boundaries for any distribution.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- Added schema-aware metadata emission path for R-side tool discovery payloads, including support for canonical per-parameter `schema` objects.

### Changed
- Updated `list_tools_json(...)` and `get_tool_metadata_json(...)` serialization to consume explicit backend schema maps for migrated tools.
- Updated manifest-parameter reconstruction for empty manifests to preserve backend metadata ordering across the OSS/PRO catalog, with explicit legacy ordering overrides for flow-family tools.
- Updated metadata enrichment to backfill missing parameter descriptions/required flags from tool metadata when doc-derived maps are absent or incomplete.

### Fixed
- Fixed stream-tool metadata typing drift for pilot tools (`extract_streams`, `vector_stream_network_analysis`) by consuming backend-authored typed schemas.
- Fixed `d8_flow_accum` metadata parameter ordering regression so frontend and binding consumers receive legacy-logical ordering (`input`, `output`, then processing options).
- Fixed generic parameter-description fallback regressions (for example ambiguous `input`) by ensuring exported metadata includes domain-specific descriptions where available.

### Release Checklist (WbW-R)
- [ ] Document user-visible API changes (new session helpers, wrapper methods, signature changes).
- [ ] Document discovery/catalog changes (search/list/describe behavior, metadata schema fields).
- [ ] Document R package facade/NAMESPACE export changes.
- [ ] Document typed object wrapper updates (`wbw_raster`, `wbw_vector`, `wbw_lidar`, `wbw_sensor_bundle`).
- [ ] Document compatibility/migration notes for renamed behavior or removed aliases.
- [ ] Record validation performed (for example `cargo check -p wbw_r`, package smoke checks).

## [2.0.3] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- Added crate-level changelog tracking for `wbw_r` with a repeatable release checklist.
- Added canonical metadata/info discovery APIs at the runtime layer:
  - `get_tool_metadata_json(...)`
  - `get_tool_info_json(...)`
  - `get_tool_metadata_json_with_options(...)`
  - `get_tool_info_json_with_options(...)`

### Changed
- Aligned runtime tool-manifest payloads with schema-first frontend consumption by exposing canonical manifest metadata via `manifest_with_io_schema_json(...)`.
- Aligned R package facade exposure with runtime metadata APIs so package consumers can call `get_tool_metadata_json(...)` and `get_tool_info_json(...)` directly.
- Updated R session helper behavior to provide `session$get_tool_metadata_json(...)` and `session$get_tool_info_json(...)` through the same discovery path used by `wbw_describe_tool(...)`.
- Updated canonical R manuals to include discovery/metadata info API references and schema-aware guidance.

### Fixed
- Reduced Python/R/QGIS metadata drift by keeping R-side metadata/info discovery aligned with the runtime schema used by frontend consumers.
